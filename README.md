Table 1: Group Assignment Reflection and Course Objectives
TASK DESCRIPTION 
During the group assignment you will be involved in group goal setting, group project work, delegation of responsibility, shared problem solving, and negotiation.
This component of the group assignment requires you to individually reflect on how well your assignment group functioned in completing the assignment task. This task is based on two components:
 Logs of work performed by you when working individually and with other group members.
 Reflection on the completed project and the functioning of your group
Keeping a written record of work performed, challenges encountered, discussions with colleagues, and reflecting on actions and their degree of success is a key part of any professional life. Accountants and auditors, for example, frequently must account for their time and engage in reflection on how they have performed and how things could have been done differently. We saw examples of this when we discussed project management. The aim of this task is to encourage you to engage in this process of documentation and reflection.
Creating a record of what happened does not require that everything runs perfectly and there are no issues. Rather, the best opportunity for reflection and development comes from recording the challenges, difficulties, and things that did not work as expected and using these as a basis for reflecting on how you could have handled things differently to generate a different outcome or how others could learn and potentially avoid similar issues and challenges.
CREATING THE WORK LOG: 
By engaging you in the process of recording your group’s progress on the group assignment and reflecting on how your group functioned, this task helps develop key skills of record keeping and reflection, while also encouraging both peer and self-evaluation.
This task is to be completed INDIVIDUALLY – 代 写ACF5904 Group Assignment - Individual ReflectionSQL

There is no minimum number of journal entries that need to be completed. Rather, you should keep a record of how you and the group progress. The template page for the work log can be copied and new pages added if needed. Work log entries do NOT have to be extensive essays. Dot points of the key issues / tasks etc are fine. They are a record of what was done, not a verbatim transcript. of everything that was said during the meeting. However, there should be enough detail to outline key tasks and responsibility allocation.
COMPLETING FEEDBACK FRUITS: 
Once your group has submitted the assignment you need to complete a peer evaluation of your group members in Feedback Fruits. This is worth 2% and will allow you to self-assess and assess your group members on the following dimensions:
 Contributing to the team’s work
o Helping the team achieve its goals or objectives by completing the assigned tasks. Your behaviors influence the quality and quantity of your contribution to the team.
 Interacting with teammates
o Providing positive interactions within the team that contribute to a supportive environment. Talking during a meeting is an important interaction but it’s important to consider how and when you say things and when you should stop talking and listen to others.
 Keeping the team on track
o Involves efforts to progress toward achieving the team’s goals.
 Expecting Quality
o Expecting quality focuses on expressing the beliefs that the team is capable of quality work and encouraging the team to strive for quality.
 Having relevant knowledge, skills and abilities
o Knowledge skills and abilities means knowing what you need to know, knowing how to do what you need to do, and having the capabilities you need to do the work of the team. Effective team members need to have or learn the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities for their assigned tasks and should be prepared to perform. other roles if needed.
You may want to keep these in mind when you are planning your project and the tasks, conduct of group meetings, and general project progress.
